# PWA Design Requirements & Implementation Plan

This document captures the design requirements, architectural plan, and next steps for the Next.js Progressive Web App (PWA) frontend of our audiobook generation service. It reflects our commitment to clear stakeholder communication, offline-first reliability (especially on iOS), and scalable, modular architecture.

---

## 1. Objectives & Scope

- **Primary Goal**: Deliver a Next.js PWA that allows users to upload documents, monitor processing status, and stream or download audiobooks for offline listening.
  - **Key Constraints**:
  - Secure authentication with session-based API key exchange in MVP; support for email/password or OAuth in future phases.
  - Full offline support (metadata + audio chunks) with user-managed storage.
  - Pre-fetch audio chunks with MSE optimization for smooth playback; resume on interruptions.
  - iOS-specific adaptations (50MB cache limit, user-gesture playback, SW lifecycle).
  - Comprehensive error handling and testing strategy.
  - Modular architecture for parallel development and easy maintenance.
  - Theming per Microsoft best practices with colors: `#FFFBDE`, `#90D1CA`, `#129990`, `#096B68`.

## 5. Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. State Management Strategy
- **Server State**: React Query for API data, caching, and synchronization
- **Client State**: Zustand for complex UI state (audio player, download manager)
- **Persistent State**: IndexedDB for offline data, localStorage for user preferences

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
- **Global Error Boundary**: Catch and handle React errors
- **API Error Handling**: Centralized error processing with user-friendly messages
- **Network Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Offline Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and sync when online

### 3. Performance Strategy
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based and feature-based splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer non-critical components
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching (browser, service worker, IndexedDB)
- **Prefetching**: Intelligent resource prefetching based on user behavior

### 4. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: All business logic and utility functions
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions and data flow
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys and offline scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Bundle size, runtime performance, and memory usage

## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Secure session-based authentication
const authFlow = {
  login: async (apiKey: string) => {
    const response = await api.post('/auth/login', { apiKey });
    if (response.ok) {
      const { sessionToken, expiresAt } = response.data;
      authStore.setSession(sessionToken, expiresAt);
      return { success: true };
    }
    return { success: false, error: response.error };
  },
  refresh: async () => {
    // Automatic token refresh before expiry
  },
  logout: async () => {
    // Clean up session and cache
  }
};
```

### Audio Streaming Architecture
```typescript
// MSE-based streaming with adaptive prefetching
class AudioStreamer {
  private mediaSource: MediaSource;
  private sourceBuffer: SourceBuffer;
  private prefetchQueue: AudioChunk[];
  
  async initializeStream(bookId: string) {
    // Initialize MSE and begin streaming
  }
  
  async prefetchChunks(currentChunk: number) {
    // Intelligent prefetching based on playback speed and buffer health
  }
}
```

## 7. Updated Stakeholder Questions

1. **Authentication**: Should we implement automatic token refresh, or require manual re-login?
2. **Analytics**: What specific metrics should we track (playback time, popular content, user engagement)?
3. **Error Reporting**: Should we implement automatic error reporting to help improve the service?
4. **Performance**: What are the target performance metrics (Time to Interactive, First Contentful Paint)?
5. **Accessibility**: What level of accessibility compliance is required (WCAG 2.1 AA is planned)?
6. **Offline Storage**: Should we implement user-defined storage limits, or rely on browser-imposed limits?
7. **Testing Strategy**: What level of test coverage is required for each module?

---

## 8. Development Workflow

### 1. Module-Based Development
- Each module is self-contained with its own tests
- Standardized interfaces between modules
- Independent deployment of completed modules

### 2. Parallel Development Strategy
- Clear module boundaries prevent conflicts
- Shared components developed first
- Integration testing after module completion

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Automated testing on each module
- Code review process for all changes
- Performance monitoring for each release

_This modular approach ensures rapid development, easy testing, and maintainable code while preserving the core vision of an offline-first, performant PWA._
