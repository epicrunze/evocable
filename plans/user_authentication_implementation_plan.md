# User-Based Authentication Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the Evocable backend from simple API key authentication to a comprehensive user-based authentication system while maintaining backwards compatibility and following security best practices.

## Architecture Goals
- **Clean & Elegant**: Build on existing JWT infrastructure
- **Backwards Compatible**: Legacy API keys continue working during transition
- **Secure by Default**: Bcrypt hashing, rate limiting, proper JWT handling
- **Separation of Concerns**: Auth logic separated from business logic
- **Database-Agnostic**: Use existing SQLAlchemy patterns

  - [x] **ROOT CAUSE**: Missing `datetime` import and outdated `auth_models.py` in Docker container
  - [x] **SOLUTION**: Added `from datetime import datetime` and rebuilt API container with latest code
  - [x] **IMPACT**: RESOLVED - All endpoints now working (155 tests passing vs 147 previously)

- [x] **7.1.2** ✅ **FIXED** - Async event loop issues
