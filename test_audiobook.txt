This is a comprehensive test of the audiobook streaming system. We are going to test the complete pipeline from file upload through text extraction, segmentation, TTS processing, transcoding, and finally audio streaming through the Progressive Web App. This text contains multiple sentences to test the segmentation process properly. Each sentence should be processed and converted into audio chunks that can be streamed seamlessly to users through the web interface.
